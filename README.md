### Key Markdown Elements:

1. **Headers**: Use `#` for large headers and more `#` for smaller sub-headers:
   - `# Heading 1`
   - `## Heading 2`
   - `### Heading 3`
   
2. **Bold Text**: Wrap text with `**` to make it bold:
   - `**Bold text**`
   
3. **Italic Text**: Wrap text with `*` for italics:
   - `*Italic text*`
   
4. **Code Blocks**: Wrap code snippets with backticks (`` ` ``) for inline code, or triple backticks (```` ``` ````) for multi-line code blocks:
   - Inline: `` `code` ``
   - Block: 
     ```bash
     command
     ```

5. **Lists**: Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists, and numbers for ordered lists:
   - `- Item 1`
   - `1. First item`

This will ensure your text is properly formatted with different styles. GitHub automatically applies its own styles to the Markdown syntax, but it doesnâ€™t support custom CSS or font size changes directly.
